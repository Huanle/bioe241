\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that the detailed balance condition for reversibility of a homogeneous continuous-time discrete-state Markov chain implies the existence of a symmetric matrix that is related to the instantaneous rate matrix by a similarity transformation.
\item Prove that the matrix exponential, as defined by Taylor series, is a valid solution for the transition probabilities of a continuous-time discrete-state Markov chain.
\item Prove that a continuous-time finite-state Markov chain necessarily has (at least) one equilibrium probability distribution over states. Under what conditions does it have more than one such distribution? Give an example.
\end{enumerate}
