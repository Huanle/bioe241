\chapter{Simulation}

Goal of this lab:
Simulate a discrete-state continuous-time Markov chain.


Provide pseudocode for more than one of these.

Implement at least one.

\presentation{Video of simulation}

Several options available.
Generate series of images using e.g. scripting language + library.
Use Berkeley MPEG encoder to stitch together into a movie,
or use one of various applications on desktop OS's that will do this.



\section{Simulate from an exponential distribution by inverting the cumulative distribution}

Pseudocode to be provided.

\section{Simulate the general reversible-time nucleotide model over a finite time interval}

\section{Simulate the general reversible-time nucleotide model over a phylogenetic tree}

\section{Simulate Gillespie's algorithm}

\cite{Gillespie77}

\section{Simulate the spatial Lotka-Volterra model on a 2D lattice}

Easy: discrete-time version.
Hard: continuous-time version.

Collect summary statistics.

\section{Simulate the 1D Ising model and the methylation-induced-CpG-deamination model}

It may be easiest to implement the general nearest-neighbor irreversible-time nucleotide model,
as both the Ising and CpG models are a subset of this.
